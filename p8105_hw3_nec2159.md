## Problem 1

``` r
instacart_df =
  instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

The data set includes 1384617 observations and 15 variables. Key
variables include information about the product ordered (`product_name`,
`department`,`aisle`) and when the order was placed (`order_dow`,
`order_hour_of_day`), along with information about the customer’s order
habits (`reorder`, `order_number`, `days_since_prior_order`).

There are 134 aisles. The top 5 aisles where most items are ordered from
are: fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetables fruits, yogurt,
packaged cheese.

``` r
instacart_df |>
  filter(n > 10000, n < 160000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = forcats::fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = aisle)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = "purple"), show.legend = FALSE) +
    labs (
    x = "Number of Items Ordered",
    y = "Aisle",
    title = "Number of Items Ordered from Each Aisle",
    caption = "Data from Instacart"
  ) 
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
popular_items_df =
  instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |> 
  count(product_name, aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  rename(times_ordered = n) |> 
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  filter(row_number() < 4) |> 
  knitr::kable()

print(popular_items_df)
```
